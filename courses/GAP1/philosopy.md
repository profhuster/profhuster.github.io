## General Analytics Physics I (GAP I)  - Fall Semesters

I designed the GAP labs following Eugenia Etkina&#39;s Investigative Science Learning 
Environment  [ISLE] (http://paer.rutgers.edu/). To quote from her web site:

> As instructors, how do we create an environment in which students can discover and learn 
> physics for themselves - to own it, so to speak?
>
> *Investigative Science Learning Environment* (ISLE), a Science Process Approach 
>that addresses this question. This approach involves students’ development of their own 
> ideas by
> 
> * observing phenomena and looking for patterns,
> * developing explanations for these patterns,
> * using these explanations to make predictions about the outcomes of testing experiments,
> * deciding if the outcomes of the testing experiments are consistent with the predictions,
> * revising the explanations if necessary, and
> * encouraging students to represent physical processes in multiple ways.
>
> The combination of these features is applied to every conceptual unit in the ISLE 
> learning system, thus helping them develop productive representations for qualitative 
> reasoning and for problem solving.

You may find these labs different from other college-level and high school physics labs.
You will often be expected to decide how you are going to do your experiment.
