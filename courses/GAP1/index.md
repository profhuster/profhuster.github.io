title: GAP I
---
## General Analytics Physics I (GAP I)  - Fall Semesters

> Experiments demonstrating principles and applications of Newtonian mechanics, 
> including kinematics, friction, force, energy, momentum, torque and simple harmonic 
> motion. 
> Students learn measurement practices, digital data analysis and error analysis.

I designed the GAP labs following Eugenia Etkina&#39;s Investigative Science Learning 
Environment [ISLE](http://paer.rutgers.edu). 
See the philosophy [here](philosophy.html).

A set of labs from a recent semester are [here](labs2015.zip). Note that the order of
the labs may change from semester to semester and the labs are often updated.
