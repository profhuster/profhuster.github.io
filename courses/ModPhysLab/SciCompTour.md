### Lectures on Scientific Computing with Python
By J. Robert Johannson's

* [Lecture-0 Scientific Computing with Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-0-Scientific-Computing-with-Python.ipynb) - I have a few comments. 
  * First, in 2015 IPython Notebook was officially renamed _Jupyter_. 
  * Second, I recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) if you are going to install python and all of its packages on your own computer. I have had no problem installing and running the whole Jupyter environment on Window, MacOsX, and Linux machines. The Mac installation is even easier now than he describes in the link.
* [Lecture-1 Introduction to Python Programming](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-Python-Programming.ipynb)
  * This is a nice quick tour through the python language. Yo ushould keep this link handy as you learn python.
* [Lecture-2 Numpy - multidimensional data arrays](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-2-Numpy.ipynb)
  * The heart of data analysis usually involves arrays of data. This link is a tour of the _numpy_ library which implements fast array math in python. You should at least scan through the first third of this page. He also shows some reading from files and plotting. 
  * The last two-thirds is optional for getting started. It covers multi-dimensional array, linear algebra, and other topics.
