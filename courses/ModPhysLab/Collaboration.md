# How to Collaborate on Lab Notes
In SMC you have a project named `Your Name – Modern Physics Lab S16`. 
SMG allows collaboration on the Project level; it doesn't have file-by-file collaboration. 
When you invite another student to collaborate, that person has access to all of your work for the course. 
If you are invited to collaborate on an experiment, do not abuse your invitation.

To invite a collaborator, click on `Projects`, then your project for the course, `Your Name – Modern Physics Lab S16`.
Click on `Settings`. In the right column part way down is a box for `Collaborators`. In the box `Add collaborators`, 
enter the persons e-mail address and type `<Enter>`. Click on their name in the search results box and click `Add Selected`. 
Within a minute, they should see a new project in their Project page with your name in the title. 
They now can access, modify, and collaborate with you in your project.

To test things out both you and your collaborator should simultaneously go to your project, and open the same file. 
If both of you start typing or editing you will each see the other person's work. This is collaboration of the best
type.
