# Modern Physics Lab
## Spring 2016
Information for the Modern Physics Lab course is on this page. Start by looking at the [syllabus](Syllabus).

## Scientific Skills
One of the goals in this course it to teach scientific skills that you will need in your career. These skills include keeping lab notes, data analysis, writing up results and making presentations. You will use several open source programs to learn these skills.

You will use the programming language python to most of your data analysis. Python is a widely used programming language that strikes a middle ground between rigorous compiled languages like C++ or Java, and easy to use scripting languages like perl, MATLAB, or Maple. It has many advanced numerical, plotting, and scientific libraries, and fast numerical libraries. These libraries make python an ideal language for data analysis and visualization.

IPython is a python shell that has extensions that make it easy to develop and run code interactively. The IPython Notebook is an extension to IPython that runs in web browsers and allows document formatting, code, equations, and figures to be interwoven on one web page. Right now, visit the example in the link at the end of this paragraph. Scroll down through and you will see text, computer code, and figures all on the same page. You will be making page like this soon! Visit this [link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb). 

Finally, SageMath Cloud (http://cloud.sagemath.com) is a free website that hosts a computing environment that includes IPython Notebooks, and much more. (A complete Linux machine, LaTeX document production, file storage, etc.) SageMath Cloud also allows a fully collaborative environment where multiple people can simultaneously edit the same file.
We will use SageMath Cloud in this course as our electronic lab notebook, data analysis platform, and document writing platform.

## Plotting with matplotlib
Everything you need to know is in the IPython notebook at this link:
