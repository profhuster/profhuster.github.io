## My Courses

### [General Analytics Physics I](GAP1) - Fall Semesters

Experiments demonstrating principles and applications of Newtonian mechanics, 
including kinematics, friction, force, energy, momentum, torque and simple harmonic motion. 
Students learn measurement practices, digital data analysis and error analysis.

### General Analytics Physics II - Spring Semesters

Experiments demonstratng principles and applicatons of electromagnetsm, 
including investgatons of magnetic and electric felds, and electrical circuits. 
Students learn measurement practces, digital data analysis, and error analysis. 

### [Optics Lab](Optics) - Fall Semesters

Laboratory demonstrating optical principles and applications. 
Experiments may vary ranging from basic single optical component set-ups to 
multicomponent set-ups,  basic and advanced interferometry, 
polarization and holography.

### [Modern Physics Lab](ModPhysLab) - Spring Semesters

Experiments demonstrating principles and applications of quantum physics. 
Students have the opportunity to reproduce historically crucial experiments such as 
the photoelectric effect, the Frank-Hertz experiment, and the Millikan oil drop experiment, 
and to experiment with nuclear decay, superconductivity, and pulsed NMR spectrometry.
