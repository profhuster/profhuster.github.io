## Interests
I love my jobs as Director of Instructional Labs because it combines two of my enduring
passions, teaching and tinkering. 

### Teaching
Since I started teaching college-level science, I have been trying to use the best 
research-based pedagogy. Early in my career I attended several workshops put on the 
[AAPT](http://aapt.org) (American Association of Physics Teachers). However the most 
influential workshop was when I attended one week of a three week workshop by the 
[American Modeling Teachers Association](https://modelinginstruction.org/). In their 
words *It applies structured inquiry techniques to the teaching of basic skills and 
practices in mathematical modeling, proportional reasoning, quantitative estimation 
and technology-enabled data collection and analysis.* Another influence is the research 
curriculum development of [Eugenia Etkina](http://gse.rutgers.edu/eugenia_etkina) and 
her colleagues at Rutgers University. Their ISLE (Investigative Science Learning 
Environment) curriculum strongly emphasizes developing scientific thinking. As Etkina 
wrote in [one posting][1] *Physics is a way of thinking - a physics mind-set is 
experiment-based and inherently challenge-oriented. . . .  Experiments in physics serve 
as a source and a test of knowledge - not just application. And when students do 
not see them this way they are deprived of the essence of physics.* 

My goal in the labs is to create a scientific atmosphere in miniature with the same type
of thinking processes going on that scientists practice in their jobs or research.
My labs are never any kind of *fill in the blank* labs, instead the students learn to 
plan and carry out measurements, to analyze the data, then reach a conclusion. Finally,
if necessary, repeat the cycle. The dialog between me and my students and between 
students is also a critical part of my methodology. I often respond to question by asking
questions or telling the student to find out what another student is doing.
