## Interests
I love my jobs as Director of Instructional Labs because it combines two of my enduring
passions, teaching and tinkering. 

### Teaching
Since I started teaching college-level science, I have been trying to use the best 
research-based pedagogy. Early in my career I attended several workshops put on the 
[AAPT](http://aapt.org) (American Association of Physics Teachers). However the most 
influential workshop was when I attended one week of a three week workshop by the 
[American Modeling Teachers Association](https://modelinginstruction.org/). In their 
words *It applies structured inquiry techniques to the teaching of basic skills and 
practices in mathematical modeling, proportional reasoning, quantitative estimation 
and technology-enabled data collection and analysis.* Another influence is the research 
curriculum development of [Eugenia Etkina](http://gse.rutgers.edu/eugenia_etkina) and 
her colleagues at Rutgers University. Their ISLE (Investigative Science Learning 
Environment) curriculum strongly emphasizes developing scientific thinking. As Etkina 
wrote in [one posting][1] *Physics is a way of thinking - a physics mind-set is 
experiment-based and inherently challenge-oriented. . . .  Experiments in physics serve 
as a source and a test of knowledge - not just application. And when students do 
not see them this way they are deprived of the essence of physics.* 

My goal in the labs is to create a scientific atmosphere in miniature with the same type
of thinking processes going on that scientists practice in their jobs or research.
My labs are never any kind of *fill in the blank* labs, instead the students learn to 
plan and carry out measurements, to analyze the data, then reach a conclusion. Finally,
if necessary, repeat the cycle. The dialog between me and my students and between 
students is also a critical part of my methodology. I often respond to question by asking
questions or telling the student to find out what another student is doing. 

### Tinkering
My dad was an engineer and he always had interesting government surplus equipment in the 
garage, so I was always taking things apart and (sometimes) back together. Experimental
Physics was an easy choice for me because it involved designing and building at a high 
level. My job of being in charge of labs is a dream job of designing and building. I get
to try making new things all of the time!

One of my first purchases at Duquesne was a 3D printer, a MakerBot Replicator 2X. It took
probably six months to learn how to use it well. Currently I use it almost every day to
make equipment for one of the labs.

My current workflow is to design with [OpenSCAD][2] saving the object in a `stl` file, 
Then I use MakerBot Desktop, the software that comes with the printer, to *slice* 
the file to `x3g` format for the printer. I save that file on a SD card, insert it in the
printer and go.

I have printed with both ABS and PLA plastics. I am coming to prefer PLA because it has 
less shrinkage as it prints resulting in better builds.

### Arduinos, etc
I have also adapted some of decades old equipment to interface with laptops using 
[Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/). The students I have pick up the Arduino wiring and
programming very quickly. I also have some [Raspberry Pi&#39;s][3] and 
[Particle Photon&#39;s][4] around for future use.
