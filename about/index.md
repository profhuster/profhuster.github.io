# About Me
 
I was born in Ohio, and raised in the southern California desert town of Lancaster. 
I majored in physics at the University of California in Santa Barbara. 
I received a master degree and Ph. D. from the University of Pennsylvania, both in 
experimental condensed matter physics. 
Kim and I got married right after I finished my Ph. D. work. 
After a two-year post-doctoral position at MIT in Boston, we moved to San Diego. 
For 11 years I worked for a government contractor designing the next generation of sonar 
for the Navy.
It was exciting work that involved planning and going on sea test, and lots of acoustic 
signal processing and data analysis.
In September 2000, we moved to Redding, California so I could teach at Simpson College 
(now University.) 
My main teaching responsibilities there were physics and astronomy for the foundational 
studies requirements. 
I also taught computer programming and upper division mathematics courses.


In the dead of winter 2010, Kim and I both took teaching positions at Nyack College, 
in both the Rockland Country and Manhattan campuses. We lived in upper Manhattan 
(Washington Heights). 
We loved living in New York City.


Finally, in the summer of 2014 we moved to Kim's hometown of Monace in Western 
Pennsylvania. 
I have a full time position as Director of Instructional Labs in the Physics Department 
of Duquesne University.
Kim teachs ESL at both Robert Morris University and Duquesne University.


We do not have children, but we have had three wonderful dachshunds, Penny, Hershey, 
and Tilly Rose.
They are all gone now, but they gave us many years of blessings.
We enjoy kayaking on the local rivers and lakes, in fact our current home includes 
riverfront on the Ohio.


Kim and I have been members of Christian and Missionary Alliance churches in San Diego 
Redding California, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
We now attend Crestmont Alliance Church in Aliquippa/Hopewell PA.


Kim and I love to travel. We have visited Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Paraguay, Jordan, 
and a number of other countries. 
We have visited many of the National Parks in the United States. Our favorites are 
Yellowstone and Arches. 
Many of our overseas travels have been on short-term trips and to visit C&amp;MA 
workers.
