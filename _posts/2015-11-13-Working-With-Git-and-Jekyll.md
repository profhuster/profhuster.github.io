### Working with git and Jekyll
This web site is mostly a way for me to learn to git and github. Along the way I 
discovered [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Simple, blog-aware, static sites") software
to make &quot;Simple, blog-aware, static sites&quot;

I am loving Jekyll. A number of years ago I wrote some python scripts to help me build
my own static web site. Jekyll does the same thing but with many more features than
my simple python scripts. I realize that I don&#39;t need full blown database generated
web pages. My needs are much more modest. 

**git** is a version control system that works hand-in-hand with the code repository
**github.io**. The usual way to use it is to write the code on your computer and use 
**git** to &quot;push&quot; your code to the **github** web site for serving it.
Github has a default Jekyll pages website for each user account, if you set 
it up. My web site is [http://profhuster.github.io/](http://profhuster.github.io/). 

This is all a great find for me!
