## [Update To Optics](http://profhuster.github.io/blog/2016/11/01/UpdateToOptics)

Date: 01-Nov-2016

This semester I am teaching five sections of General Analytical Physics 1 Lab and one section of Optics Lab. See the links on my Courses page.

## Optics Lab
I added a link to the course from the Courses page.
I also added a link to Darryl Ozimek's Electronics course. I do some consulting on the Ardunio labs.
